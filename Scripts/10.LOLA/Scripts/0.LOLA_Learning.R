#Load data and universe
#Both need to be GRANGES objects
data("sample_input", package="LOLA") # load userSets
data("sample_universe", package="LOLA") # load userUniverse

#How you run the test
# runLOLA tests for pairwise overlap between each user set and each
# region set in regionDB. It then uses a Fisherâ€™s exact test to assess 
# significance of the overlap. The results are a data.table with several columns:
locResults = runLOLA(userSets, userUniverse, regionDB, cores=1)
